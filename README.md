# Playing-Cards
Beetroot Academy - Lesson 21

Create a row of playing cards.

When the user opens the page they should only see the backside of the cards,
when the user hover on the card --> the card should flip around and the card should be displayed.

Use HTML and SCSS to create the flipping cards.
